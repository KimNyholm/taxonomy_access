To install, simply add the database and activate the module, in these steps.

1) From the command line, type 'mysql -u username -p drupal < taxonomy_access.mysql' where drupal is your drupal database and username is your mysql username

2) Copy taxonomy_access.module to your drupal installation's module directory

3) Activate the module from administer >> modules

4) Remove the default 'view all' permission if you plan on hiding certain categories from users.  Execute the following SQL

DELETE FROM node_access where nid=0 AND gid=0 AND realm='all' AND grant_view=1 AND grant_update=0 AND grant_delete=0;

5) Configure the access to the various categories from administer >> users >> configure >> category permissions


Note:  When removing this module, you'll need to reinstall the default 'view all' permission.  Execute the following to restore the system to the default value

INSERT INTO node_access VALUES (0, 0, 'all', 1, 0, 0)
