---------------------------------------
For complete changelog, see:
http://drupalcode.org/project/taxonomy_access.git/log/refs/heads/7.x-1.x

o Renamed "List" and "Create" grants to "View tag" and "Add tag" for clarity.
o Automatically update node access as needed on shutdown.  
  Hooks should merely add their list of nodes to 
  taxonomy_access_affected_nodes() to be processed at the end of the request.
o Provide record deletion API.
