Taxonomy Access 7.x-1.x-dev, xxxx-xx-xx
---------------------------------------
For complete changelog, see:
http://drupalcode.org/project/taxonomy_access.git/log/refs/heads/7.x-1.x

o Renamed several API functions:
  - from: taxonomy_access_grant_update()
    to:   taxonomy_access_set_term_grants()
  - from: taxonomy_access_defaults_update()
    to:   taxonomy_access_set_default_grants()
  - form: taxonomy_access_recursive_grant_update()
    to:  taxonomy_access_set_recursive_grants()
o Renamed "List" and "Create" grants to "View tag" and "Add tag" for clarity.
o Automatically update node access as needed on shutdown.  
  Hooks should merely add their list of nodes to 
  taxonomy_access_affected_nodes() to be processed at the end of the request.
o Provide record deletion API.
