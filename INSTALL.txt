TO INSTALL, simply install and enable the module, in these steps.

PLEASE CHECK, that you use the right version of Taxonomy Access for DRUPAL.
  (For 4.7.x, use taxonomy_access-4.7.0.tar.gz)

NOTE: If you want to USE TWO OR MORE "ACCESS" MODULE AT THE SAME TIME, TEST IT 
      CAREFULLY. (e.g: OG, node_privacy_by_role, taxonomy access, etc.)
     (This has been made easier with the new node_access system in 5.x.)

TO UPDATE from previous versions of taxonomy_access: PLEASE READ UPDATE.TXT!
  WHEN UPDATING, ALWAYS disable the module first (admin/modules) before uploading
  the new module.

-----------------------
INSTALLATION:
-----------------------

1) COPY all files in the taxonomy_access directory to your drupal installation's
   module directory (/sites/all/taxonomy_access/)

2) ENABLE THE MODULE on page: "Administer >> Site building >> Modules"

3) CONFIGURE OPTIONS FOR TAXONOMY ACCESS: Go to page:
   "Administer >> Site configuration >> Taxonomy Access settings".

4) SET PERMISSION 'Administer Access Controll' FOR ADMINISTRATORS on page: 
   "Administer >> User Management >> Access Control".

5) CONFIGURE ACCESS PERMISSIONS to the various categories from 
   "Administer >> User Management >> Taxonomy Access permissions".

NOTE: DATABASE TABLES are automatically added to database. Module creates two 
      tables in database: 'term_access' and 'term_access_defaults'.

-----------------------
TROUBLESHOOTING:
-----------------------

In case of: 
- You have any troubles with node access 
    (users can view/edit pages, they do not have permission),
- Or for general database housekeeping of tables 'node_access'
    (also 'term_access' and 'term_access_defaults'): 

Do the following:
- First 'Disable', then 'Re-enable' the 'Taxonomy Access Module' on page: 
    "Administer >> Site building >> Modules".
  This will force the complete rebuild of the 'node_access' table.
