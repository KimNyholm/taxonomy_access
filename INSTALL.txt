TO INSTALL, simply add the database and activate the module, in these steps.

NOTE: Personally, I DO NOT RECOMMAND USING TWO OR MORE "ACCESS" MODULE AT THE SAME TIME (e.g: OG, node_privacy_by_role, taxonomy access, etc.)at the same time, only in case you know exactly what you are doing, and if you tested it thoroughly. 
  (If you used other access modules before, read the 'Troubleshooting' section)

PLEASE NOTE: There is no need to patch the taxonomy.module anymore. (it was neccessary only in previuos versions of Drupal 4.5 and 4.6)

1) UPDATING DATABASE: 
    For MySQL:
      From the command line, type 'mysql -u username -p drupal < taxonomy_access.mysql' where drupal is your drupal database and username is your mysql username

    For PostgreSQL: 
      Use the provided script in "taxonomy_access.pgsql". 
      (NOTE: Users of older versions of PostgreSQL - prior to PostgreSQL 8.0 - should use the script "taxonomy_access_prior8.pgsql" instead. There was no BIT_OR aggregate function by default in PostgreSQL. It is needed to make a BIT_OR aggregate function.

2) COPY taxonomy_access.module to your drupal installation's module directory

3) ACTIVATE THE MODULE from administer >> modules

4) ENABLE TAXONOMY ACCESS SETTINGS: Go to administer >> settings >> taxonomy_access and enable the module

5) CONFIGURE ACCESS PERMISSIONS to the various categories from administer >> access control >> category permissions

TROUBLESHOOTING:

For general housekeeping of the 'node_access' table, go to /admin/settings/taxonmy_access: First 'Disable', then 'Enable the taxonomy_access module'.
  This regenerates the 'node_access' table (only the values related to taxonomy_access) according to taxonomy_access settings (stored in table 'term_access').

If you have troubles with node access (users can view/edit pages, they do not have permission), and you used other access modules before (OG, node_privacy_by_role, etc.). 
  Try this: after backing up the database, try deleting values from the "node_access" table ( TRUNCATE 'node_access' ).  Then for regenerating the "node_access" table (according to TAC settings) go to /admin/settings/taxonmy_access: First 'Dsable', then 'Enable the taxonomy_access module'.
