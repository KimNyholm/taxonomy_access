To install, simply add the database and activate the module, in these steps.
  PLEASE NOTE: There is no need to patch the taxonomy.module anymore.
  
1) UPDATING DATABASE: 
    For MySQL:
      From the command line, type 'mysql -u username -p drupal < taxonomy_access.mysql' where drupal is your drupal database and username is your mysql username

    For PostgreSQL: 
      Use the provided script in "taxonomy_access.pgsql". 
      (NOTE: Users of older versions of PostgreSQL - prior to PostgreSQL 8.0 - should use the script "taxonomy_access_prior8.pgsql" instead. There was no BIT_OR aggregate function by default in PostgreSQL. It is needed to make a BIT_OR aggregate function.

2) COPY taxonomy_access.module to your drupal installation's module directory

3) ACTIVATE THE MODULE from administer >> modules

4) ENABLE TAXONOMY ACCESS SETTINGS: Go to administer >> settings >> taxonomy_access and enable the module

5) CONFIGURE ACCESS PERMISSIONS to the various categories from administer >> access control >> category permissions
